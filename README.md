<h1>Python Scrapy-Basic Sample Walmart Scraper</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The project consists of a simple Python Scrapy project (simple meaning it does not scrape all the important data, for this is only a portfolio) capable of scraping as many pages as needed in the Java-rendered website of Walmart while avoiding detection and getting blocked by the anti-bot of the website completely.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 
- <b>Scrapy FrameWork</b>
- <b>Scrapy-Selenium Library</b>

<h2>Note:</h2>
To have this project fully up and running, you need an API key from the free or paid account of ScrapeOps. I have removed mine from the code for obvious reasons.
